# Custumer-Insights-Toolkit-Data-Cleaning

Customer Insights Toolkit is a Python-based Colab notebook for cleaning and analyzing raw customer data. It standardizes user information, calculates total revenue, segments customers by age and spending, and analyzes purchases by category. Providing structured insights for basic CRM and marketing decisions.

## Problem Solved

In many business scenarios, raw customer data can be inconsistent, incomplete, or difficult to analyze directly. This toolkit addresses the need for initial data preparation and provides methods to extract valuable information such as total revenue, specific customer segments (e.g., young high-spenders), and purchasing habits across different product categories. It serves as a foundational step for deeper customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing analytics.

## Key Features

*   **User Data Cleaning:**
    *   Standardizes user names (lowercase, removes extra spaces/underscores, splits into first/last name).
    *   Converts age data to integer type.
    *   Normalizes product categories to lowercase for consistent analysis.
*   **Revenue Aggregation:** Calculates the total revenue generated by all users based on their recorded spending.
*   **Customer Segmentation:** Filters users based on:
    *   Age criteria (e.g., users under a certain age).
    *   Combined criteria like age and total spending.
*   **Category-Specific Analysis:** Identifies users who have purchased within specific product categories and aggregates their total spending.
*   **Illustrative Simulation:** Includes an example of a `while` loop for simulating incremental purchases until a target amount is reached.

## Getting Started

To run this project, simply open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or any Jupyter-compatible environment. The code is written in Python and uses basic list manipulations. No external libraries are strictly required for the core functionalities, although `random` is used for the simulation example.

### Data Structure

The `users` data is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains:

1.  User ID (string)
2.  User Name (string - before cleaning, list of strings - after cleaning)
3.  Age (float - before cleaning, int - after cleaning)
4.  List of Categories (list of strings)
5.  List of Spending Amounts (list of integers)

### How to Use

1.  **Define `users` data:** The notebook starts with an example `users` list.
2.  **Run Cleaning Functions:** Execute the `clean_user` function and its application loop to preprocess the `users` data.
3.  **Perform Analysis:** Run the subsequent cells to:
    *   Calculate total revenue.
    *   Filter users by age or spending.
    *   Use `get_client_by_cat` to find users interested in specific categories.

Feel free to modify the `users` data or the filtering criteria to suit your specific analysis needs.
